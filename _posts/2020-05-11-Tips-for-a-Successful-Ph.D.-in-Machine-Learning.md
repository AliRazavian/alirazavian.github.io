Ph.D. is one of the few practices that almost no one does it twice. There are lots of people with multiple M.Sc.s or are repeat entrepreneurs. But I have yet to meet someone in person with two Ph.D.s. Ph.D. uniquely defines your future.

This article is a compilation of ideas and conversations that I had with my colleagues, my students, and my friends in conferences, universities, and the industry."

# 1- Make sure Ph.D. is the right choice for you

“Should I go to the industry, or should I get a Ph.D.? Do I need a Ph.D. anyway?” This is among the top questions that almost all my M.Sc. students ask me. And my answer is more or less the same: “It depends”.

# 1- 1- What should the Ph.D. be about?

Machine learning sits on the border of engineering and science. Science begins with the problem while engineering starts with the solution. The best scientific publications are the ones that define the problem so well that the solution is trivial. In engineering, on the other hand, the emphasis is on the solution. Engineers are trying to find a problem to the existing solutions. With that in mind, let’s focus on the different levels of higher education.

During the bachelor study, you learn what the field is about. Master programs teach you how to do things and in Ph.D., you learn why you are doing whatever you are doing.

Before starting a Ph.D., you should deeply think about whether this is something you are interested in or not. Unfortunately, the majority of Ph.D. students in our field are not questioning the “why”. They simply focus on “how”. They get a Super Master degree with the title of Ph.D.

Ph.D. salaries are almost an order of magnitude less than what one gets in the industry. Deadlines are crippling and rejections feel personal. Ph.D. is a personal investment. If you are not learning to ask the right questions, frankly speaking, you are wasting the best years of your life in academia. If your Ph.D. is about adjusting the hyper-parameters, then maybe the industry is a better place to be. But if you genuinely want to understand what is happening under the hood of learning and intelligence paradigms, academia desperately needs you.

# 1- 2- Is the timing right for your topic of research?

In our field (like many others), progress looks like a logistic curve. First, there is a time when the hypotheses are mostly wrong and the paradigms are incomplete. Then comes a period where academia figures out a useful paradigm. And a few years later, the industry learns to make money out of this progress and the incremental research is shifted entirely to the industry. Machine learning’s latest major step was end-to-end and deep learning in the early 2010s, that followed the previous steps of applicable machine learning of early 2000s and the analytical model of early 1990s and so on. Every step created a wave of industrial applications that reshaped the direction of research and academia.

Ideally, you would want to be in a field, where before you start your Ph.D., few people care about it, and by the time you finish it, everyone is using it. And you have made a major contribution to that field. If the industry is already making money out of that field of research, you are too late. Go to the industry or find another field.

## 1- 3- Is it the right time in your life to do a Ph.D.?

It is important to consider whether or not the time is right in your life to embark on a Ph.D. program. Some of the most interesting dissertations or publications I've seen have come from individuals who begin their Ph.D. in their late twenties. This may be because as we mature and experience the world, we develop a philosophy that can be useful during the Ph.D. process. However, as we get older, our lives can become more crowded and it can be harder to focus on our ideas.

It is worth noting that there is a counter hypothesis that the brain continues to develop and create new connections until the age of 25, and starts losing connections after 30. This suggests that our brain is at its sharpest in our late twenties. However, this is not a hard and fast rule - for example, Newton invented calculus and discovered physical laws by the age of 23 and was highly influential.

If you are young and have a strong idea, don't let this discourage you from pursuing a Ph.D. However, in general, I would encourage younger applicants to go out and experience life, gain some work experience to understand what the industry looks like, and even consider pursuing another master's degree before committing to a Ph.D. in a specific field of science. This can broaden your horizon and potentially lead to new insights and ideas for your Ph.D. research.

# 2- What should one aim for in their Ph.D.?

As I mentioned earlier, the Ph.D. is not about learning new tricks, although eventually whatever solution you come up with is a mix of existing solutions, you should focus on problem definition or “why”. There is no formula for inventing a new paradigm, but there is one approach that could help you in your Ph.D. and possibly your life.

## 2-1- Learn the history of your field

Always look for misplaced pieces of the puzzles. Things that don't make sense, but somehow have made their way to the current paradigms and everyone treats them as truth.

Let me share an example: When I started my Ph.D. in computer vision, some common algorithms extracted roughly 250MB of features from a 25KB jpeg image. Mathematically speaking, those algorithms are, at least, either 99.99% redundant or 99.99% noisy or most likely, both. I even got into a heated argument with a senior researcher in our lab, he advised me to be more modest and accept that I'm not smarter than an entire field. But I couldn't unsee the absurdity of it. I kept looking for better image representations and managed to be part of a movement that convinced the computer vision community to leave behind noisier representations in favor of Deep Learning.

So where do these noisy assumptions come from? These solutions were initially supposed to be some filler pieces in a bigger puzzle when they were published. In my example, in the late 90s, SVM classifiers proved to be effective and efficient. Around the same time, the computer vision community invented good corner-based features to solve multi-view geometry. Then it was only a matter of time for the brightest people of our field to figure out they could combine those features with the classifier and classify photography images and achieve OK-ish results, which was a huge deal in those times. And in 2012, I had to convince people that these features weren't invented for classification in the first place. But somehow the history was lost and the temporary solution was widely accepted.

You can find these never-meant-to-last solutions everywhere. For example, before 2014, the computer vision community believed that a computer vision classification solution is made up of two independent components. A segmentation component that segments objects in an image without knowing what they are. And, another component that takes the segmented images and classifies them. If you look at the classification datasets that were released before 2014, you could see that many of them had a segmentation mask with it. The ultimate combination of these two tasks (segmentation and classification) is a task called semantic segmentation. Both of these assumptions were crushed by deep learning in 2014, but somehow, researchers and startups are still offering solutions to a problem that doesn't exist anymore. Millions of people annotating images pixel by pixel for hundreds of annotation startups to sell it for billions of dollars to customers to solve irrelevant problems.

What's clear from the examples is that if you learn the history of your field, you will know why people are doing what they are doing and whether it makes sense to continue doing the same thing.

# 3- What to look for in a supervisor?

As I mentioned, most likely you only get one Ph.D. in your life. If your Ph.D. is successful, you will likely continue the line of thought that you acquired in your Ph.D. for a big portion of your life. Your supervisor is the key player in shaping your world philosophy and helping you gain the most important portion of your professional knowledge. Some even refer to their supervisor as their academic father or it is common to hear that someone inherited their supervisor’s work. With absolutely no doubt, your Ph.D. is exactly as good as your supervisor. So what should one look for in a supervisor?

## 3-1- Competence

Competence is the most important characteristic to look for in a supervisor. But it is hard to define competence. Citation indices correlate with how influential a scientist is but it does not capture the whole picture. Particularly, citation indices suffer from a recurring pattern in academia.

A common pattern among successful labs is that there is a topic that the lab has made a major contribution to it. They were working on that topic before it was cool. And then, the topic takes over the filed. From that point on, the lab grows because they are a couple of years ahead of everyone else. And this trend continues until the next revolution happen. Historically speaking, those labs are generally resisting the change. But as the new paradigm takes over, these labs compensate for their late response by flooding the filed with minor to negligible contributions (thanks to the sheer number of researchers they have from the money they got for working on previous paradigms). and in doing so, increase their citation indices.

The best place to be is in the labs who are working on exciting topics that few have ever worked on. Unfortunately, there is no one who could tell you where the best next idea is. All I can say is that if everyone is working on a topic, it is too late to start your Ph.D. there. As a general rule in life, try to walk ahead of the crowd, not behind them. In my opinion, competence and citations do not have high correlations. People who understand the field walk in front of the crowd and miss on the citations that the incremental works give to each other. If you can, find supervisors who are willing to leave behind the low-hanging fruits of the current paradigms for the search of another better one. Go to Google Scholar and search for researchers who have made contributions to the current paradigms when it was in its infancy but have moved to other topics, now that the field has become too crowded.

## 3-2- Support

A great friend of mine who is also a mentor to me finished his Ph.D. with only one publication: his dissertation. His supervisor stood by him when the committee confronted him about the lack of publications. The supervisor explained that the student’s thesis is of high quality and should be judged by itself. What the supervisor asked from the committee was obviously against the university’s regulation that demands quantitatively measurable publication before the Ph.D. defense. But he supported his student, who is now one of the brightest -and in my opinion, one of the most revolutionary- senior researchers in Machine Learning.

In a different scenario, a while ago, I was on a committee for a half-time seminar. The student was working on an obsolete problem and I was curious as to whether there is more to this problem or the student is simply wasting his time. So I asked him why he is doing this. He seemed well aware of the uselessness of his works. He was wasting his time then, but why? I kept questioning him to the point that he had no answers to my questions. At this point, the supervisor simply told me that he is working on this problem because they wrote the grant on it. The proposal was written at least 4 years ago, approved 3 years ago and the student began his research two years ago when the content of the proposal was already obsolete. Poor guy was wasting the best years of his life because the supervisor didn’t have the backbone to talk to the grant committee, which by now, must have known the content of the grant proposal is obsolete.

Ph.D. is not a linear process. Universities try to introduce regulations because they are part of a bureaucratic system after all. These regulations are handy when the supervisor doesn’t want to directly confront the students. I don’t blame the universities. But A good supervisor protects you from the regulations. A bad supervisor imposes them on you.

## 3-3- Chemistry

Here are some numbers to consider: An average professional partnership lasts for almost a full decade. Ph.D.s And marriages last for an average of almost half a decade. Average time in the same job, in our field is around 1-2 years depending on the source. So, on average, you spend as many days with your Supervisor as you spend with your husband/wife. Make sure you have the right chemistry before signing a legal contract. Some supervisors micromanage, some let you decide. Some supervisors are mature, understanding, and supportive, some are needy fragile overgrown kids. Whatever works for you, make sure you enjoy spending time with your supervisor as she/he is probably one of the longest-lasting and most influential people in your adult life.

# 4- You have the right to walk away

We learned different skills in different stages of academia. In Ph.D. in particular, we hopefully learn to push when there is a light at the end of the tunnel or walk away when we feel there isn’t. It is common that you have a publication that was novel when you wrote it but was rejected because of a typo or missing a citation. And by the next deadline, a concurrent version of the same idea is already published. So you have to choose to reduce your idea to just a version of the previously published version or let it go. This is particularly troublesome if you are at the end of your Ph.D. and you have multiple rejected papers at hand that you just want to see them published. But something that is less considered, is that you can apply the same logic to your dissertation. If your Ph.D. is not working and there is no light at the end of the tunnels, you could always walk away from your Ph.D., Here are some but not all the patterns that could justify giving up your Ph.D.

## 4-1- Bad supervisor

There was a bright Ph.D. student that I used to hang out with at conferences. He was full of ideas, he was smart and always optimistic. Suddenly he stopped coming to conferences. No publications from him for two years until I met him again in a conference. He was a broken agitated man. Turned out, there was a new professor in their department, and his supervisor gave him to the new guy. The new professor lost interest in his research in less than a month and left him by himself, pressuring him to finish as soon as possible with absolutely no supervision and threatened him for two years that if he doesn’t finish soon, his salary would disappear. He had to publish all by himself and share the credits with these two gentlemen. His Ph.D. didn’t introduce any new ideas. All his later publications were below mediocre quality. This is not a unique story though. Many began their Ph.D. as a hopeful winner who wants to change the world and end up broken individuals who drag their feet under the unnecessary stress imposed on them by their supervisors.

This level of long-lasting stress is neither good for your health nor your research. Research is a creative task and requires delicate focus and creativity. Which both disappear under severe stress. If you are sacrificing your health and research just to get a paper with a Ph.D. \<your name\> written on it, maybe it is time to reconsider your choices.

## 4-2- Abuse and Harassment

Creativity and fear cannot coexist. So long as you don’t feel safe, you won’t achieve anything in your Ph.D. I wasn’t sure if I should put this section in the article, but let me share with you the story of a senior researcher who walked away victorious.

It is customary in most departments that when someone leaves, on the last day, the department members have lunch together and the researcher presents something, mostly her works. In this story, the researcher began her talk with how two professors on multiple occasions harassed her. She didn’t stop there though, she had been contacting every female researcher that left the department and shared their stories of harassment. After the presentation, other female employees began sharing their stories and all stories pointed at those two professors. By the time the lunch was over, the dean had had sent both professors on a long vacation and as far as I know, the hero of this story didn’t hit any career setbacks. The moral of this story is that you are not alone, you don’t need to suffer alone. But make sure have a strategy in advance. Always hope for the best but plan for the worst. Fight back, stand your ground, or walk away if you need to.

# 5- Let’s start a Ph.D.

If you haven’t started your Ph.D. yet but you want to, maybe there are things you could do to increase your odds of having a better Ph.D.

## 5-1- Follow your passion

This is a cliché, but make sure you enjoy the topic you are going to work on and search for supervisors in that field. It is not easy to find a supervisor when you are still unfamiliar with the topics of the field. I personally planned a reading marathon. Before starting my Ph.D. I was reading publications 12 hours a day for three weeks straight while doping two pots of coffee per day. I was underlining every keyword I didn’t understand and add the citations to my reading stack. It wasn’t the happiest three weeks of my life but I learned a lot about the field and I was certain about the topic I wanted to work on during my Ph.D.
## 5-2- Find the right supervisor

After gathering a list of people that you like their research, it is time to find the ones that you could create a fulfilling relationship with. You can always contact the supervisor’s students, graduates, and dropouts and ask them about the supervisor. Contacting the graduates is better than contacting the students because they have seen more of the supervisor’s attitudes. Graduates also have less to worry about if they are to share negative feedback. If you could find any dropouts, make sure you contact them and talk to them first.
## 5-3- Have a solid application

A Ph.D. ad in the top 100 universities gets at least a thousand applicants. Rejection is the norm, acceptance is the exception. But still, there are things you could do to increase your odds. Your application is pretty much an advertisement. You are advertising yourself to the professor in a competitive market.

A good SoP generally addresses three topics. a) Why you are a good choice for the supervisor, b) why the supervisor is a good choice for you, and c) why this Ph.D. program is mutually beneficial to both of you. In the SoP, you should specifically address what the supervisor needs to know.

University professors have many responsibilities. They spend most of their time teaching, preparing teaching materials, correcting exams, writing research grants, and of course, supervising master and Ph.D. students. Not to mention the research itself, or multiple companies they sit on their boards and their personal life.

When professors get new students, they know exactly how much of their valuable time they are going to lose. What they gain from hiring you, however, is unknown. Applicants who could convince professors that their risk to return ratio is low have significantly higher chances.

Doing an internship with the supervisor is a great practice. You get to know the problem you are going to work on and the support you could expect from the supervisor. The supervisor gets to know you too. Which eliminates their risk of hiring you. If it was a paid internship, all the better. And if it wasn’t, well, if you are not willing to invest in yourself, who would?

So what if one couldn’t get an internship? Well, you could always do what you would’ve done in your internship, in your bedroom. Read every paper the supervisor and their students have written, try to reproduce the results. Email the supervisor or their students and ask them for guidelines. Don’t ask obvious questions though. Make sure the answer to your questions cannot be found on the net or worse, in the supervisor’s publications. Soon you will see that there are ideas that have not been implemented yet. Mostly because there are not enough resources in the lab. Keep working on those ideas and keep asking for guidelines through emails until you become relevant to that lab’s research. The best Ph.D. students are the one who takes initiative and gets things done with minimum guidance. If you could pull it off in your bedroom, you are not a risk to the supervisor anymore.
# 6- The first two years of your Ph.D.

The first two years are the most important times in your Ph.D. This is the time that you master the history of your field. In this period you should learn to ask “why”. You will learn how to write a paper and how to deal with the emotional aftermath of rejections. This is the period that you could know for sure if your supervisor is supporting your research or you are on your own. There are necessary practices that you could do in this period that could give you a boost in the second half of your Ph.D.

## 6-1- Math is everything

We have never built a more useful tool in our history than math. In most Ph.D. programs one has to pass certain number of credits and my advice is to spend those times investing in your math skills. If your choice is between two courses, Generative Models in Machine Learning or Topology in Machine Learning, I recommend the latter.

## 6-2- Get your hands dirty

When I read a paper, I usually read it once, and often not even to the end. Maybe just the abstract, method, introduction, and conclusions (in that exact order). When I’m about to review a paper or when I’m presenting it, I usually read it twice or thrice. But If I have to implement a paper, I usually end up reading it 10 times or more in the process. Every time I read the paper, I learn something new about it and I never forget the papers that I have implemented.

Trying to implement the papers gives one a much higher understanding of them which is quite valuable when one is in their early stages of their Ph.D. Some of the weird statements that are found in a paper only start to make sense when one is implementing them. And as soon as you implement a paper, you are suddenly full of ideas that can be tested quickly. If that was an old paper, then you could easily see your ideas in the papers that followed the original paper.

## 6-3- Publish incremental research with minor contributions

Anyone who has learns a new language knows that there is a huge difference between understanding a language and speaking it. If implementing an existing algorithm is like understanding the language of your field, then publishing a paper is like speaking it.

There are many great other advantages to incremental research as well. Having an actual publication eliminates lots of your stress, and makes it easier for you to cross the publication count barrier when the bureaucracies start to become annoying. Your supervisor is probably happier with you and you will have more freedom to work on less straight-forward problems. You will practice writing, submitting, and rebutting an idea to a conference in a much safer setting where the rules are clearer. And most importantly, at least in my opinion, when you are not getting noticed, you will learn how useless your Ph.D. could be if you are not willing to take a risk and move away from the crowded topics.
