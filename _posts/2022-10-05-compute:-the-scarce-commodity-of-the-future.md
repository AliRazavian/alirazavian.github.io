Cryptocurrencies and AI are increasing their energy consumption at alarming rates. Cryptocurrencies currently consume more than 1% of the world’s energy, and AI is another electricity-hungry technology. Here are two graphs that show the growth of these technologies:


The energy sector can handle some level of fluctuation, but cryptocurrency and AI energy consumption is reaching concerning levels. Energy consumption typically varies between 1–4% annually, but cryptocurrency consumption is currently approaching 2%, which could cause blackouts.

Two years ago, blackouts became a problem in developing countries, some of which banned bitcoin mining in response. Last fall, Eastern Europeans experienced blackouts and had to borrow electricity from Western Europe. NGO’s and governments have been focused on making the energy industry more sustainable, but this growth in cryptocurrency and AI energy consumption could lead to a shortage of energy resources. It’s important to carefully monitor and regulate this growth to prevent further disruptions.

But cryptocurrencies are not the only sector that are devouring energy at an exponential rate. AI is on the rise, and its rise is dwarfing crypto:


Compute as a Commodity

AI and the Bitcoin algorithm are automating two domains that were previously exclusive to the human mind: intelligence and trust.

Both AI and crypto are energy-intensive forms of computing that convert one type of information into another. Today, “compute” is the most valuable commodity, just as “information” was a generation ago. With the current price of energy, it is more profitable to use energy for computing than for any other purpose.

The value of spending $1 on energy to build an average car is approximately $3, which is almost the same as mining Bitcoin. However, the car manufacturer must pay for raw materials, salaries, and other expenses, whereas the return on spending $1 of energy for AI is significantly higher.
What can be done?
The short-term solution

The electricity grid has been the primary source of energy since its inception, but this needs to change. Instead of relying on the grid to provide energy, we should mandate that anyone who consumes energy generates all of their own needs. The power grid should be redefined as a way to mitigate the risk of local and temporary failures, rather than as the main provider of energy. This will require significant investments from both the public and private sectors.

30 years ago, when the internet was young, Swedish politicians correctly foresaw that this technology would fundamentally change our society. They chose to embrace this change by bringing high-speed internet to every home, school, office, and factory. This early decision helped to propel the Swedish economy and society for an entire generation. Now, we are entering another era-defining time.

Change is coming, and we must choose whether to change with it or by it. There is no other option.
The long-term solution: Tame the beast

In my opinion, the problem is more complex than it may seem at first glance. Carbon-based organisms have been competing for access to energy for billions of years, and now, in less than 60 years, silicon-based organisms have secured 5% of all the produced energy in the world for themselves. This trend is only expected to continue growing exponentially. Solar panels are replacing trees, and algorithms are replacing people.


To effectively compete with 2010 technologies, we need a technology from 2020 or beyond. The only way to convince corporations, investors, and consumers to abandon AI and crypto is to create a technology that is superior in terms of return on investment, energy consumption, and capabilities.

Ultimately, we – the humans – will tame the silicon beasts or perish trying.
