The reported numbers about COVID-19 seems unreasonably diverse and inconclusive. The main reason for it is that the asymptomatic cases are significantly more than the symptomatic cases and that leaves huge dark data that overshadows every analysis. the detected cases (the people who actually show symptoms) are biased towards the elderly and makes it impossible to estimate the total affected cases.

But as one particular country experiences the COVID19 pandemic, we can finally get a grasp of the actual distribution.

Iceland is big enough to report conclusive unbiased statistics on the distribution of the disease and at the same time, wealthy and small enough to afford collecting such stats. And as the number of reported cases in Iceland surpass 1000 people, the statistics become more and more reliable. With that said, let’s look at the diagnosed COVID19 cases based on age. On the left, we have more or less every country in the world who tests the patient in the hospitals. And on the right, there is the Icelandic distribution.

--[The distribution of “detected” cases for COVID19 per age for countries that test new cases in the hospitals vs Iceland that uses random sampling for case detection.]

On the right side, we see statistics from Sweden, Italy, and Spain. There are many more 80+ people who catch the disease than people in their twenties. In every country, except for Iceland, the patient has to have symptoms, then, if they chose to, they go to the hospital and get tested. The Icelandic chart makes a lot of sense. there are by far fewer people over 80 years old than there are 50 years old, so it is only natural to have significantly fewer cases in the elderly. Also, retirement reduces the exposure of people so it is natural to have fewer +65 cases.
So let’s take the Icelandic distribution as the actual distribution of COVID19 cases in the early stages of the pandemics, and the European distribution as the “detected” distribution and try to estimate the actual number of cases who have caught the disease as reported until 5 April 2020.

--[Age groups have different sensitivity to COVID19. By adjusting the biased Swedish statistics of age-groups with non-biased data of Iceland (both in the early stage of progress) we can see that at least more than 96% of cases remain undetected.]

The first sanity check shows that the detection rate per age group has a correlation of more than 0.97 with the mortality rate per age group.

After adjusting the age-group statistics, we can see that more than 96% of cases remain undetected and therefore, not part of any statistics. applying the 4% detection rate to 1.5% mortality rate among detected cases leaves the total mortality rate close to 0.06%. As the hospitals overwhelmed with the cases, only the most severe cases come to the hospital and the detection rate drops even further, leading to the increase of mortality rate in those countries.

Having such a low detection rate explains why COVID19 is so contagious and also why even though countries introduce different policies, the pandemic behavior remains the same. Everyone will get the disease and pass it on in such a short time that by the time quarantine policies are introduced, it is too late to contain the disease.

But to make sure that our estimate is correct, we need another sanity check. If we assume that everyone will catch the disease, by the end of the pandemic, the total death toll should be around 0.06 percent of the population. We fit a logistic curve to the data coming from the European and American countries with high enough cases confirm that if the disease is indeed out of control and it will spread and end in approximately 75 days from the day it started.

--[By considering the high number of undetected cases most likely everyone will catch COVID19 and the pandemic will likely reach its end in 75 days from the day it started.]


Now that we know our model of the disease is mathematically consistent with the reported observations, here are some of the conclusions and take-homes from our model:

1- COVID19 is far more contagious than previously assumed.

2- More than 96% of the population will get the disease and transmit it without developing serious symptoms. This extremely high and dark number of cases is the reason that so many contradictory conclusion comes out of this disease.

3- The pandemic period is around 75 days. in the first three weeks, the number of cases increases exponentially, in the next three weeks, the number of new cases per day plateau and in the final 3 weeks, the number of new cases drops exponentially.

4- The incubation period is 5 days on average and the symptomatic period is 2–3 weeks. Which means, by the time the first death is recorded, the exponential period of growth is almost over, although it will take another three weeks for the fatality rate to stop growing exponentially.

5- Different countries have introduced different quarantine policies at different points in their pandemic (generally after the death toll is piling up)but the data is consistent among different countries (at least in western countries) meaning that quarantine is introduced too late and it is less useful than it was thought if any.

6- COVID19 will spread across all the 1 billion citizens of the western world in the next months. making it the first organic virus that outpaces digital viruses. It will leave behind 600,000 casualties before the summer. The United States experience almost 180,000 death, Europe will see 400,000 death. Sweden’s death toll will be around 6,000 people. The vast majority of the victims will be elderly people with preconditions.

7- COVID19’s fatality rate is 0.06%, slightly less than the seasonal flu’s CFR. But you are 300 times more likely to catch COVID19 than the flu. remember that when you calculate the risk for yourself.

8- As I’m writing this piece, my grandma (89 years old) is struggling with COVID19 for the last 10 days and our family is deeply concerned about her health. If you have elderly relatives or friends, maybe it’s a good idea to pick up the phone and talk to them more often.

9- Among countries and regions who reported high pandemic numbers, Wuhan and Iran’s fatality cases fit well in our model except for the fact that it is almost an order of magnitude less than what our model predicts. Numbers reported from other parts of China don’t follow our model’s pattern. South Korea and Japan seem to have gotten the pandemic under control.

10- Emotions are what make us human. No one should blame people, communities and nations to react emotionally to such catastrophic phenomena. It is in our nature to react the way we react, but numbers do not care about our emotions. A great leader should find a way to reach out to people and convince them to act rationally.

11- This is a traumatic experience for us. It is likely that we lose a loved one to this disease. A grandparent, mother, father, a friend, a teacher or a neighbor, and we will definitely know many who will have lost a loved one to this disease. Big European countries like Germany, UK, and Italy experience almost one thousand death per day every day for almost three weeks. The US will likely experience 4000–5000 death per day every day for three weeks and most likely our loved ones are among them. These numbers will feel personal. If the pandemic psychology is anything like the market psychology, We, -a billion citizens of the western world- are likely to act emotionally and against our collective interest.

12- This is by far, the hardest conclusion I have written in my life. But numbers don’t care about our emotions. At least in the western world, it is inevitable that everyone will catch COVID19. A better resource management strategy is to focus on retired people and make sure that they are well isolated from society during the pandemic.

13- I’m not a big fan of what’s happening in the media and our society right now. Regardless of the country, the rival political parties attack the ruling party for not doing enough without any consideration of how traumatic this pandemic will be in two months. The society is nothing but the trust we have in the institutions, the alienation of the hard-working branches of governments -just when we are about to experience the biggest death toll streak of our time- may not end well for our democratic states and our collective well being.
