Some websites, that rank scientists based on their publications, have put me in the top 100 most influential scientists in Computer Vision and Machine Learning in the last decade.

Besides that, sometimes, I lift heavy stuff repeatedly, and often daydream of sleeping for 8 hours straight. I like to think about the implication and impacts of technology on our culture and society. I try my best to show the potential of technology to as many as I can and warn them about the side effects of it.
